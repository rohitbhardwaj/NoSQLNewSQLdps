If you're not running Cassandra locally, start it up in a docker container with:

    docker run --name n1 -d tobert/cassandra

If you're running Cassandra locally, you'll find 'cqlsh' in the same 'bin' directory as 'cassandra' mentioned above.
If you're running docker, run cqlsh with:

    docker exec -it n1 cqlsh

Create a keyspace with:

    create keyspace nfjs with replication = {'class':'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor':1};

Create a table in this keyspace with:

    use nfjs;
    create table talks (id varchar primary key);

Optionally attempt to create the table again with:

    create table if not exists talks (id varchar primary key);

(and note that you will not get an error as long as the 'if not exists' is present)

Add a few columns to the talks table with:

    alter table talks add duration int;
    alter table talks add released timestamp;
    alter table talks add speaker varchar;

Add a comment to the table with:

    alter table talks with comment = 'A table of talks';

View the complete table and all its default properties with:

    desc table talks;

Drop and recreate a more complete talks table with:

    drop table talks;
    create table talks (
        id varchar primary key,
        name varchar,
        speaker varchar,
        audience int,
        duration int,
        cc boolean,
        released timestamp
        ) with comment = 'A table of talks';

(Note that when entering the lines as above cqlsh will automatically detect a multi-line CQL statement)

View the completed table one last time:

    desc table talks;


docker stop n1 n2; docker rm n1 n2;

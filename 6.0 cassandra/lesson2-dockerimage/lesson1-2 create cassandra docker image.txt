To deploy a single Cassandra node to this docker host, run this command:

docker run --name=n1 -d tobert/cassandra

You need the IP of this first container to pass as a parameter to subsequent
containers, so to find the IP address, run this command:

docker inspect -f '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' n1

To add a second node to the Cassandra cluster, run this command:

docker run --name=n2 -d tobert/cassandra -seeds IP

(where IP is the IP address you retrieved in the previous step)

At any time you can check the status of the cluster by running:

docker exec -it n1 nodetool status

(In fact, you can run it on any node:  n1 or n2)

You can view the virtual node token allocations by running:

docker exec -it n1 nodetool ring

You can log into one of the containers and view the configuration file with:

docker exec -it n1 /bin/bash
vi /data/conf/cassandra.yaml

Esc : q

exit

When you're done, stop and remove the Cassandra containers with:

docker stop n1 n2 
docker rm n1 n2

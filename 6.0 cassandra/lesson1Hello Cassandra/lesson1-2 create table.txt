Start cassandra node
./cassandra

start sql tool
./cqlsh

	drop keyspace nfjs;


    create keyspace nfjs with replication = {'class':'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor':3};
	exit
Examine the token allocations for this keyspace by exiting cqlsh and running a new nodetool command:

    ./nodetool describering nfjs

Run nodetool status, supplying the name of the keyspace, and notice that each node "owns" 100% of the data:

    ./nodetool status nfjs

Now run cqlsh again and drop and recreate the keyspace with a different replication factor:
    ./cqlsh
	
    drop keyspace nfjs;
    create keyspace nfjs with replication = {'class':'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor':1};
	exit
	
Run nodetool status again and notice that now each node only "owns" about a third of the data:

    ./nodetool status nfjs

Run nodetool describering again and notice that each token range is only allocated one endpoint:

    ./nodetool describering nfjs

Take one of the end_token values from these results and find it in the nodetool ring output:

    nodetool ring | grep [end_token]
